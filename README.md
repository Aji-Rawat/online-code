## Acknowledgements

We would like to express our gratitude to the following technologies and frameworks that have been instrumental in the development of this project:

- **MongoDB**: For providing a robust and scalable NoSQL database solution that powers our backend data storage.
- **Express.js**: For its simplicity and flexibility in building RESTful APIs and handling middleware in our Node.js backend.
- **React**: For enabling us to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces with its component-based architecture.
- **Node.js**: For its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that allows us to build efficient and scalable server-side applications.

Without these technologies, our project would not have been possible. We also extend our thanks to the vibrant communities surrounding these technologies for their support, documentation, and contributions.
